                <p class="para1"><br>The navigation bar has an elegant design with a striking color palette with active links in #353535 and hover effects styled with #d2e12c. All the fonts are set in Trebuchet MS ensuring elegance and readability throughout the webpage.

                <p class="para2"><br>As Student 2, I designed a homepage with a logo, navigation bar, footer with editor page links, and four content-related images. Having an external CSS file allowed to keep the same style throughout the site. I shared this file with the other members of my team and worked with them to help guide them through the process, to ensure a smooth integration and troubleshoot any issues which they may have had. </p>

It consists of textboxes for name, email, and phone number, and radio buttons to rate the site navigation and service satisfaction. The layout was created with a minimal and clean style using Trebuchet MS font to offer a user-friendly and clarity experience. In addition, JavaScript confirmation was added for each field to ensure no required details were missed. </p>
